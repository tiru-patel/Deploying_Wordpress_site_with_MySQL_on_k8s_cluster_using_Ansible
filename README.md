# :sparkles:Deploying WordPress site with MySQL Database on Kubernetes cluster using Ansible:sparkles:
Creating our own multinode kubernetes cluster is very tedious task.Also, deploying websites, eg: WordPress which is highly integrated and dependent on MySQL database in a manual way is very slow and prone to errors.So, here is the solution for automating the creation of kubernetes multinode cluster and deploying wordpress site using Ansible on AWS. 

## :heavy_exclamation_mark: Steps to be followed to achieve this task :heavy_exclamation_mark: 

:one: Create a ansible role to *provision ec2 instance*. Here, provisionEC2 role. 

:two: Setup ansible dynamic inventory. 

:three: Create a ansible role to configure *kubernetes master* node. Here, k8s_master role. 

:four: Create a ansible role to configure *kubernetes slave* nodes. Here, k8s_slaves role. 

:five: Create a ansible role to create Wordpress and MySQL pods. Here, wpSQL role. 

:six: Create a playbook that will run provisionEC2 role. Here, setupec2.yml playbook. 

:seven: Create a playbook that will run k8s_master and k8s_slaves role. Here, setup_cluster.yml file. 

 <br>
To create a role, use command :leftwards_arrow_with_hook:

      ansible-galaxy init provisionEC2 
     
Similarly, you can create other roles.

### :beginner: How to setup dynamic inventory? :beginner:
:pushpin: Copy the hosts directory in your workspace. 

:pushpin: In ansible configuration file, change the inventory=<path_of_host_directory>(above folder) 

:pushpin: In ec2.ini file, at the end provide your AWS_ACCESS_KEY and AWS_SECRET_KEY 

<br>

### :dart: Setting up main playbooks :dart:
:pushpin: Here, setupec2.yml and setup_cluster are the main playbook. 

:pushpin: setupec2.yml playbook will launch 3 instances for us. Here, I have made the VPC, Subnet, Image, instance type fixed. You can add as a variable and include the variables in /vars/main.yml file in the provisionEC2 role. Also, the *OS_Name* list consists of tags to be provided to the instances launched.

:pushpin: After running setupec2.yml playbook, wait for ssh to come up. You can also verify launched instances on AWS Portal.

:pushpin: Now, run the setup_cluster.yml playbook to configure master and two slave nodes. 


:exclamation: Copy the master token and provide as input when slaves role run. :exclamation:

:pushpin: Finally, you can verify by the output that, we can run kubectl command. That means it is configured successdfully :ok_hand:

:pushpin:Optional: You can merge both the playbooks setupec2.yml and setup_cluster.yml by providing a long pause in between launching ec2 and configuring master node. This is necessary as it would take some time for SSH to come up so that Ansible can further do configurations.
