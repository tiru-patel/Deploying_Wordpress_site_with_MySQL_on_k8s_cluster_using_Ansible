k8s_slaves
=========

This role is used to configure Slave Nodes of kubernetes. 


Role Variables
--------------

We don't have as such variable to provide. But when we call the role, we need to provide one variable i.e Master Token. Through master token generated by **k8s_master role**, slave node can join the master. 

Dependencies
------------

As in k8s cluster, without Master Node, we cannot configure Slave nodes. So, **k8s_master** role is to be run first. We get the master token at the last. We need to copy that token and when this role i.e k8s_slave run, it prompts for master token as input. We need to paste that token and finally the multinode kubernetes cluster is configured. 

Example Playbook
----------------

    - hosts: ["tag_Name_k8s_Slave1","tag_Name_k8s_Slave2"]
      vars_prompt: 
        - name: master_token
          prompt: Enter master token 
          private: no 
      roles: 
        - name: configure slave node   
          role: /root/k8s_play/role/k8s_slaves
